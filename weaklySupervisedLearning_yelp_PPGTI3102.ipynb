        "\n",
        "Using the Yelp review dataset and the stars field as a label for sentiment analysis, let's create a pipeline that employs weakly supervised learning to handle labeling the Yelp review texts as positive or negative. First, we will generate initial labels using regex-based functions (weak labels). Next, we will refine these functions to improve their accuracy. We will then compare the performance of our models on ambiguous data (2, 3, 4-star reviews) versus less ambiguous data (extremes, 1 and 5-star reviews). This comparison will help us understand how the classification of our data affects the outcome, depending on how we set the threshold for positive or negative sentiment. Additionally, we will analyze how the nature of our data influences these results."
